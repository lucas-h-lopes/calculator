# Project error handling üõ†Ô∏è

In this project, three custom exceptions were created:

__UserInputException__: Handles invalid user input, such as entering a string instead of a number, specifying a nonexistent operation type, or leaving a name field blank.

__CalculatorException__: Ensures that ``number2`` provided by the user is not zero when attempting division.

__UserAnswerException__: Manages the project's repeat loop logic. If the answer is '**Y**', the program runs again. If the answer is '**N**', the program finalizes and prints the calculations made by the user while it was running. If the answer is **any other value**, the program ends without printing the calculations.
